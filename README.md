# Bank Marketing Exploratory Data Analysis

**Author's note:**

This is my first data project. I have tried to apply everything what I learned from the courses, tutorials and self-education about data prep and exploratory data analysis in Python. The project probably has many mistakes. We all had to start somewhere, right? :) Feel free to check it out.

**About the dataset:**

The data comes from direct marketing campaign of a Portuguese bank. The marketing strategy was based on telephone outreach of current bank's clients. Clients were offered the product (a bank term deposit).

**Goals of the Project:**

1. Clean the dataset
2. Explore the dataset
3. Visualize the dataset

**Next steps:**

1. Improve, improve, improve
2. Machine learning?
